# 🎯 Project Vision: Quiz Sci Game

**Quiz Sci Game** is an open, modular and educational science quiz game designed to promote learning through interactive questions and real-time feedback. The goal is to build a flexible, data-driven platform that supports dynamic content, extensibility, and educational engagement — all deployable with a single Docker container.

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

- 🧠 Build an educational web app focused on science quizzes.
- 🌐 Create a simple, responsive frontend with HTML/CSS/JS.
- 🐍 Use Python (Flask) as the main backend engine.
- 📄 Load questions dynamically from a JSON file (no recompilation required).
- 🐳 Containerize the entire app for consistent, portable deployment.

## 📈 Future Extensions

The project will evolve to include:

- 🧩 Hints (tips) per question
- 🧾 Persistent storage with SQLite or PostgreSQL
- 👥 User scoring, stats and session history
- 📊 Visual feedback (charts, graphs)
- 🌍 Internationalization (multilingual quizzes)
- 🧪 STEM-focused content for educational purposes
